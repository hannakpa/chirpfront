# Frontend: chirpfront
Bootcamp Final Project. Frontend for Chirp website. ReactJs + ReactBootstrap. 

## Project description
Chirp is a platform for those digital nomads that come to Barcelona. In this platform, the users can publish the objects they currently need and those they would like to give out to some other users. The users can ask for an object through a private message and the owner can decide if they would grant it to them. This platform aims certain transparency, so everybody can see how many objects they have given out (and to whom) and received (from whom). This way, Chirp can reach a balance and would be sustainable for the community.
